The AGIRAILS n8n Community Node v2.0.2 is now available with updated API naming conventions that match the SDK v2.0.3 release.

<!-- truncate -->

## Installation

```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-actp
```

**npm:** [n8n-nodes-actp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-actp)
**GitHub:** [agirails/n8n-nodes-actp](https://github.com/agirails/n8n-nodes-actp)

## What's New in v2.0.2

### API Naming Consistency

This release aligns the n8n node with the updated SDK naming conventions:

| Old Name | New Name |
|----------|----------|
| `beginner` | `basic` |
| `intermediate` | `standard` |
| `BeginnerAdapter` | `BasicAdapter` |
| `IntermediateAdapter` | `StandardAdapter` |

### Updated SDK Dependency

The node now uses `@agirails/sdk` v2.0.3 which includes:
- Consistent API layer naming
- Improved type definitions
- Enhanced mock mode stability

---

## Breaking Changes

If you were using custom n8n workflows with ACTP nodes, review your configurations:

**Before (v2.0.1):**
```javascript
// Old adapter references in test overrides
overrides: {
  beginner: { ... },
  intermediate: { ... }
}
```

**After (v2.0.2):**
```javascript
// New adapter references
overrides: {
  basic: { ... },
  standard: { ... }
}
```

Standard n8n workflow nodes should work without changes - the internal adapter names are abstracted away in the UI.

## ACTP Operations Available

The n8n node supports both API layers:

### Basic Operations
- **Pay** - One-liner payment with automatic escrow
- **Get Balance** - Check USDC balance
- **Get Transaction** - Retrieve transaction details

### Standard Operations
- **Create Transaction** - Create with full parameters
- **Link Escrow** - Lock funds in escrow
- **Transition State** - Move through ACTP lifecycle
- **Release Escrow** - Complete transaction and release funds
- **Get All Transactions** - List all transactions

---

## Example Workflow

```
[Trigger] -> [ACTP: Pay] -> [IF Success] -> [Slack Notification]
                                |
                                v
                        [ACTP: Get Transaction]
```

The Basic Pay operation handles the full ACTP lifecycle:
1. Creates transaction
2. Links escrow
3. Returns transaction details

Perfect for simple agent-to-agent payment automations.

## Network Support

| Network | Chain ID | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Base Sepolia | 84532 | Active (Testnet) |
| Mock Mode | - | Available |

Mock mode is ideal for testing workflows without blockchain interaction.
